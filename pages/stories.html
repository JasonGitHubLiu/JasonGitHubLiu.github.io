<p id="paragraph">
	Hey everyone, my name is Jason Liu, and my favorite hobby used to be lifting, however, I have started to explore new things like 3D printing/modeling and photography. My favorite animes of all time are Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, and Naruto.

	Another fun fact about me is that I played four different sports in high school. Football, Wrestling, Track & Field, and Powerlifting. Someday, I would like to get into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or Strongman. (I'd like to become the world's strongest Asian man, however, I've got a long way to go.)
